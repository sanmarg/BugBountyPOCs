Hi team,I've been able to takeover subdomain at sub.xyz.com, the CNAME entry in the subdomain is pointing to an external page service (attacker.com).

Vulnerability Detail:
A subdomain takeover occurs when an attacker gains control over a subdomain of a target domain. Typically, this happens when the subdomain has a canonical name (CNAME) in the Domain Name System (DNS), but no host is providing content for it.

Vulnerable Url:
1)...
2)...

Security Impact:
An attacker can utilize this domain sub.xyz.com for targeting the organization by fake login forms, or steal sensitive information of teams (credentials, credit card information, etc)

FIX & MITIGATION:
You should immediately remove the DNS-entry for this domain or point it elsewhere if you don't use that service
Contact vendor asap for patch or launch a Fix

Please let me know if more info needed or any help,
Best Regards,
Your NAME
